Well here we go, a new personal site brings many new challenges and hopefully exciting things to focus on. One of them is to see about starting to blog my adventures into tech, exciting things I have built or are building along with random rambles from the ether that is my brain.

### Short introduction

My job & personal endeavours could be summed up by saying I tell computers what to do, and sometimes they listen.

The best problems are when someone thinks it cannot be done and you go away and build something in a strange creative way that does exactly what they wanted. Those projects are the best because you feel worthwhile at that point, you proved to yourself why you do what you do and that you can do something with your skills.

When I am not coding (either at work or in personal time), I am volunteering, being social or playing games. As of right now I am mixing two of those things by having a crack at [Screeps](https://github.com/KirstyWright/screepsAI).

### Why have a blog

There have been times when I solve a problem and then have the same problem six months later with no record of how I solved it, a blog fixes that issue and also gives a platform to be able to help other people with similar issues. Sharing knowledge is a crucial part of being a good developer, and I have lacked in that department recently. This blog should also allow me to research new shiny things for a reason before I would not be motivated to do some things because there was no end goal. Writing a blog post is a goal I can apply to many projects or ideas which will give that motivation.

Finally, it lets me keep a record of what I have done and how I am doing. Regularly I will feel like I am not a great dev because I will see all the fantastic stuff other people build and then see I have nothing to show for the years I have been doing this.
